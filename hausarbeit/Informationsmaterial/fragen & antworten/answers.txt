The inventory is important for companies for several reasons.

Compliance with legal requirements: In many countries, companies are legally required to conduct an inventory. This serves to comply with tax regulations, accounting standards, and commercial regulations.
Identification of theft or inventory errors: The inventory helps identify any theft or inventory errors that may have occurred. It also helps in avoiding overstocks or shortages by efficiently managing the inventory.
Basis for financial reporting and analysis: The inventory provides data that is incorporated into the company's financial statements. This data is used for financial reporting and is relied upon by investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to assess the company's financial position and performance.
-
There are various types of inventory procedures used in companies. The selection of the appropriate procedure depends on the type of business, the size of the inventory, and the legal requirements. Here are some common inventory procedures:

Periodic inventory: In periodic inventory, the inventory is physically counted at specific intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually.
Perpetual inventory: In perpetual inventory, the inventory is continuously and constantly monitored and updated throughout the year. This allows for regular and ongoing inventory tracking.
Cycle counting: Cycle counting involves counting a portion of the inventory on a regular basis, typically on a cycle or rotational basis. This helps ensure that the entire inventory is counted over a specified period of time.
ABC analysis: ABC analysis categorizes inventory items based on their value and importance. This helps prioritize inventory management efforts and focus on high-value items.
Just-in-time (JIT) inventory: JIT inventory management aims to minimize inventory levels by receiving goods from suppliers only when needed for production or customer orders. This reduces holding costs and improves efficiency.
-
The accuracy and completeness of the inventory can be ensured through various measures. Here are some ways:
Thorough preparation and planning
Use of inventory procedures
Careful physical inventory counting
Utilization of technological aids
Controls and plausibility checks
Independent verification
Documentation

Auxiliary accounts
Private accounts: Private accounts are used to record transactions between the company and its owners or shareholders.
-
Entries in the general ledger are made to update the various accounts and document the financial transactions of a company. The recording of entries in the general ledger typically follows the "double-entry" principle of double-entry bookkeeping, where each transaction requires at least two entries - a debit entry and a credit entry.
The process of recording entries in the general ledger includes the following steps: identifying the transaction, making the debit and credit entries, making the offsetting entry, and documenting the transaction.
-
The general ledger is linked to other accounts in accounting through entries.
The linkage is accomplished through the principle of double-entry bookkeeping, where each transaction requires at least two entries - a debit entry and a credit entry.
Debit to Credit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The general ledger is a central accounting document in which all business transactions of a company are systematically recorded. It serves as a kind of account overview and contains all the accounts of the company.
The general ledger has several important functions:

Account management
Documentation
Monitoring
Preparation of financial statements
Error identification and correction
-
When recording a transaction in the general ledger, the following information is typically documented:

Date
Account number
Description
Amount
The entries are recorded according to the double-entry bookkeeping system, where each entry is assigned both a debit and a credit amount. These entries represent the exchange between the various accounts in the general ledger and keep the account balances up to date.

The documented journal entries in the general ledger serve to capture and track all the financial transactions of a company.
-
To identify and correct possible errors in the general ledger, the following measures can be taken:

Reconciliation of accounts
Control calculations
Review of the booking processes
Use of account reconciliation systems
Internal control measures
The specific steps for correction depend on the nature of the error. Typically, incorrect entries are reversed and replaced with correct entries. It is important to document all changes and corrections in a traceable manner and to record the reasons for the corrections.

Profit and loss accounts are accounts in accounting used to record the revenues and expenses of a company during a specific business period. They are used to determine the profit or loss of the company and enable a detailed analysis of income and expenses.
The role of profit and loss accounts is to track and categorize the financial impacts of business activities. They allow a company to allocate its revenues, costs, and expenses to different accounts to obtain a better overview of its financial performance.
Profit and loss accounts can be divided into various categories:
Revenue accounts
Expense accounts
Profit and loss accounts

The recording of profits and losses typically occurs at the end of an accounting period, such as the end of a fiscal year. Profits are debited and losses are credited to the respective profit and loss account.
-
Profit and loss accounts have a direct impact on the income statement of a company. The income statement is an important financial document that presents the revenues (income) and expenses (costs) of a company for a specific period, usually a fiscal year.
Sales revenue: Higher sales result in higher revenues and potentially higher profits.
Expense accounts: Higher expenses lead to lower revenues and potentially lower profits or even losses.
Profit and loss account: The balance of the profit and loss account directly affects the profit or loss reported in the income statement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The profit and loss account (also known as the income statement or statement of earnings) is a central account in a company's accounting system. It is used to record all the revenues (income) and expenses (costs) of a company for a specific period, usually a fiscal year. The profit and loss account serves the following functions:
Recording of revenues
Recording of expenses
Determination of profit or loss
-
Revenues:
Sales revenue
Interest income
Dividend income
Rental income
Commissions

Expenses:
Personnel costs
Material costs
Rent and leasing expenses
Marketing and advertising expenses
Interest expenses
Taxes
Depreciation
-
The basic formula for the income statement is:
Profit/Loss = Revenues - Expenses

The basic steps to determine profit or loss are:
Summing up revenues
Summing up expenses
Determining profit or loss
By subtracting total expenses from total revenues, the profit or loss is calculated. If revenues exceed expenses, there is a profit. If expenses exceed revenues, there is a loss.

Depreciation is an important accounting practice that allows for the recognition of the decrease in value of assets over their useful lives.
Here are the reasons why depreciation is important in accounting:

Bilancial Accuracy
Timely Cost Allocation
Profit Determination
Tax Implications
Investment Decisions
-
Linear depreciation: In linear depreciation, the decrease in value of an asset is distributed evenly over its useful life. This means that the same amount of depreciation expense is recognized in each accounting period.
Declining balance depreciation: Declining balance depreciation allows for a higher depreciation expense at the beginning of the asset's useful life, with a gradual reduction in subsequent years. This method recognizes that assets often lose value more rapidly in their early years of use.
Unit-of-production depreciation: Unit-of-production depreciation captures the decrease in value of an asset based on its actual usage or production output. Under this method, the depreciation expense is directly tied to the asset's usage, such as the number of units produced or hours of operation.
-
In the income statement, depreciations are recorded as expenses. They decrease the profit of a company since they reflect the decrease in value of assets over their useful life.
In the balance sheet, depreciations affect the asset values. The book value of an asset is reduced by the amount of depreciation. As a result, the balance sheet reflects the actual value of the asset at a given point in time.
-

Choice of depreciation method
Utilization of special depreciation
Identification of tax-favored assets
Timing of investments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard tax rate: The standard tax rate is the general tax rate applied to most goods and services. It varies from country to country and can, for example, be 19%, 20%, or 21%.
Reduced tax rate: A reduced tax rate is often applied to certain goods and services considered essential or in the public interest. These may include items such as food, books, medication, or public transportation. The reduced tax rate is generally lower than the standard tax rate.
Zero tax rate: Some countries impose a zero tax rate on certain goods and services, meaning no sales tax is charged for these products. Examples of items that may fall under the zero tax rate include exported goods or certain financial services.
Special tax rates: In some cases, special tax rates may apply to specific industries or products. For example, tobacco products, alcohol, fuels, or luxury goods may have higher tax rates.
-
The application of sales tax rates is done by the seller or service provider, who calculates the sales tax in the sale price or invoice issued to the customer. The seller is obligated to remit the collected sales tax to the relevant tax authority. The customer, who acquires the products or services, pays the corresponding tax amount as part of the purchase price.
-
Input tax, also known as VAT input or pre-tax, is the amount of value-added tax paid by a company for purchases and business expenses. It represents the VAT charged on the purchase price of goods or services. The input tax can be offset by the company as a prepayment against the VAT liability it receives from its customers.
The calculation of the VAT amount that a company must remit to the tax authorities is typically done by taking the difference between the VAT collected from its customers and the input tax paid for its own purchases. If the input tax exceeds the amount of VAT collected, an excess amount is obtained, which is refunded to the company.
-
Liquiditätsanalyse: The analysis of VAT payments and input tax refunds can provide insights into the liquidity situation of a company. If a company makes regular high VAT payments, it can impact its liquidity.
Steuerplanung: By effectively utilizing input tax refunds, a company can reduce its tax burden and improve its financial performance.
Kostenanalyse: The analysis of input tax can provide insights into the cost structure of a company.
Compliance and risk management: This helps to avoid financial risks such as penalties and interest.
